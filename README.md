# :tokyo_tower: Internet Of Things -project
This is the repository for the projects of the Internet of things (IOT) course held at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/).

During the course, 4 different assignment were delivered, each one on a different case study about a in use technology. A final project was developed to complete the study of the subject.

### 1) First Challenge
The goal of the first challenge is to analyses the network traffic log with [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) :shark: and answer to some question. In the relative folder are present:
* the [traffic log](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%201/homework1.pcapng)
* a [file](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%201/1-%20Challenge%201.pdf) with the question
* a [file](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%201/1A-%20Challenge%201.pdf) with the answer

### 2) Second Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to generate messages from a CSV  files to be sent to your own [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) channel through [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/) using MQTT. In the relative folder are present:
* the [node-red dump](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%202/node-red_code.txt) that contains the code of the node-red flow
* [Report](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%202/Report.pdf) that describe all the development phases.
* ThinkSpeak channel [link](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1710628)

### 3) Third Challenge
The Goal of the challenge is to send data from a mote to 
thingspeak using MQTT, exploiting [TinyOs](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyOS) and [Cooja simulator](https://anrg.usc.edu/contiki/index.php/Cooja_Simulator). In the relative folder are present:
* [Report](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/blob/main/Challenge%203/Report.pdf) that describe all the development phases
* [TinyOS project](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/tree/main/Challenge%203/Source%20code) that contains the code of the mote
* [Node-red dump](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/IOT-project/tree/main/Challenge%203/Source) that contains the code of the node-red flow

### 4) Fourth challenge
The goal of the challenge is to simulate a Wireless sensor Network with [TOSSIM](http://tinyos.stanford.edu/tinyos-wiki/index.php/TOSSIM). The network is composed by  2 motes talking between each others. In the relative folder are present:
* [Report]()that describe all the development phases.
